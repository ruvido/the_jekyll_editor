# ===================
# TODO
# ===================

- how to handle when publish:ok but other fields are missing (it goes back to draft)

- published but why the image remained in the preview directory? (5p2p)

- automatically create a slug from title

- create a list of scheduled posts in the -preview page-

- make a _today.lock file to be used as a trigger to push the repo (functional for the scheduled posts)



- be cool if "iblog" could be set automatically in a configuration process (rake)
=> better than that, having a git clone of the thing as "bare" blog. Using rake
   to initialize the whole thing.

- simplify the publishing:
=> one folder for draft posts
=> one folder for images
=> edit link for pull requests in the preview phase

**EMAIL

- send emails via mailgun instead of gmail (no password)
